MET	c-Met-M-E_GBL1115829.txt	c-Met-M-E	**Used for QC**	Mouse	CST	3127	Met, a high affinity tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF, also known as scatter factor) is a disulfide-linked heterodimer made of 45 kDa ?- and 145 kDa ?-subunits. The ?-subunit and the amino-terminal region of the ?-subunit form the extracellular domain. The remainder of the ?-chain spans the plasma membrane and contains a cytoplasmic region with tyrosine kinase activity. Interaction of Met with HGF results in autophosphorylation at multiple tyrosines, which recruit several downstream signaling components, including Gab1, c-Cbl, and PI3 kinase. These fundamental events are important for all of the biological functions involving Met kinase activity. The addition of a phosphate at cytoplasmic Tyr1003 is essential for Met protein ubiquitination and degradation. Phosphorylation at Tyr1234/1235 in the Met kinase domain is critical for kinase activation. Phosphorylation at Tyr1349 in the Met cytoplasmic domain provides a direct binding site for Gab1. Research studies have shown that altered Met levels and/or tyrosine kinase activities are found in several types of tumors, including renal, colon, and breast. Thus, investigators have concluded that Met is an attractive potential cancer therapeutic and diagnostic target.	http://www.cellsignal.com/products/primary-antibodies/3127?hit=productId&Ntt=3127

EIF4E	eIF4E-R-V_GBL1115719.txt	eIF4E-R-V	Valid	Rabbit	CST	9742	Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binds to the mRNA cap structure to mediate the initiation of translation (1,2). eIF4E interacts with eIF4G, a scaffold protein that promotes assembly of eIF4E and eIF4A into the eIF4F complex (2). eIF4B is thought to assist the eIF4F complex in translation initiation. Upon activation by mitogenic and/or stress stimuli mediated by Erk and p38 MAPK, Mnk1 phosphorylates eIF4E at Ser209 in vivo (3,4). Two Erk and p38 MAPK phosphorylation sites in mouse Mnk1 (Thr197 and Thr202) are essential for Mnk1 kinase activity (3). The carboxy-terminal region of eIF4G also contains serum-stimulated phosphorylation sites, including Ser1108, Ser1148, and Ser1192 (5). Phosphorylation at these sites is blocked by the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 and by the FRAP/mTOR inhibitor rapamycin.	http://www.cellsignal.com/products/primary-antibodies/9742?hit=productId&Ntt=9742

PARP1	PARP_cleaved-M-E_GBL1115821.txt	PARP_cleaved-M-E	**Used for QC**	Mouse	CST	9546	PARP, a 116 kDa nuclear poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, appears to be involved in DNA repair in response to environmental stress. This protein can be cleaved by many ICE-like caspases in vitro and is one of the main cleavage targets of caspase-3 in vivo. In human PARP, the cleavage occurs between Asp214 and Gly215, which separates the PARP amino-terminal DNA binding domain (24 kDa) from the carboxy-terminal catalytic domain (89 kDa). PARP helps cells to maintain their viability; cleavage of PARP facilitates cellular disassembly and serves as a marker of cells undergoing apoptosis.	http://www.cellsignal.com/products/primary-antibodies/9546?hit=productId&Ntt=9546
PARP1	PARP1-R-V_GBL1115798.txt	PARP1-R-V	Valid	Rabbit	Santa Cruz	sc-7150	Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), also designated PARP, is a nuclear DNA-binding zinc finger protein that influences DNA repair, DNA replication, modulation of chromatin structure, and apoptosis. In response to genotoxic stress, PARP-1 catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose units from NAD(+) to a number of acceptor molecules including chromatin. PARP-1 recognizes DNA strand interruptions and can complex with RNA and negatively regulate transcription. Actinomycin D- and etoposide-dependent induction of caspases mediates cleavage of PARP-1 into a p89 fragment that traverses into the cytoplasm. Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation from the mitochondria to the nucleus is PARP-1-dependent and is necessary for PARP-1-dependent cell death. PARP-1 deficiencies lead to chromosomal instability due to higher frequencies of chromosome fusions and aneuploidy, suggesting that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation contributes to the efficient maintenance of genome integrity. PARP-2 is part of the base excision repair (BER) pathway, catalyzing the poly(ADP-ribosy)lation of nuclear proteins. PARP-2 is a nuclear, DNA-binding protein which interacts with PARP-1. PARP-2 is present in actively dividing tissues with highest levels in the kidney, skeletal muscle, liver, heart and spleen.	http://www.scbt.com/datasheet-7150-parp-1-h-250-antibody.html

Pdcd4 also suppresses the transactivation of activator protein-1 (AP-1)-responsive promoters by c-Jun. Pdcd4 contains two Akt phosphorylation sites, one at Ser67 and the other at Ser457. The phosphorylation of Pdcd4 by Akt causes nuclear translocation of Pdcd4 and a significant decrease in the ability of Pdcd4 to interfere with the transactivation of AP-1-responsive promoters by c-Jun.	http://www.rockland-inc.com/store/Apoptosis-Antibodies-600-401-965-O4L_18137.aspx

RB1	Rb-M-E_GBL1115824.txt	Rb-M-E	**Used for QC**	Mouse	CST	9309	The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein Rb regulates cell proliferation by controlling progression through the restriction point within the G1-phase of the cell cycle. Rb has three functionally distinct binding domains and interacts with critical regulatory proteins including the E2F family of transcription factors, c-Abl tyrosine kinase, and proteins with a conserved LXCXE motif (2-4). Cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation by a CDK inhibits Rb target binding and allows cell cycle progression. Rb inactivation and subsequent cell cycle progression likely requires an initial phosphorylation by cyclin D-CDK4/6 followed by cyclin E-CDK2 phosphorylation. Specificity of different CDK/cyclin complexes has been observed in vitro and cyclin D1 is required for Ser780 phosphorylation in vivo.	http://www.cellsignal.com/products/primary-antibodies/9309?hit=productId&Ntt=9309

Upon mitochondrial stress, Smac/Diablo is released from mitochondria and competes with caspases for binding of IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins). The interaction of Smac/Diablo with IAPs relieves the inhibitory effect of the IAPs on caspases. This interaction involves mainly the amino-terminal residues of Smac/Diablo with the BIR3 region of XIAP, supplemented with several other hydrophobic interactions between the helical structures of Smac/Diablo and other areas of BIR3.	http://www.cellsignal.com/products/primary-antibodies/2954?hit=productId&Ntt=2954

Indeed, loss of E-cadherin expression is correlated with the invasive properties of some tumors and there is a considerable inverse correlation between Snail and E-cadherin mRNA levels in epithelial tumor cell lines. In addition, Snail blocks the cell cycle and confers resistance to cell death. Phosphorylation of Snail by GSK-3 and PAK1 regulates its stability, cellular localization and function.	http://www.cellsignal.com/products/primary-antibodies/3895?hit=productId&Ntt=3895
